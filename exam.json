        "human": "How To Prepare for NEET and JEE Simultaneously",
        "assistant": "NEET and JEE are both some of the toughest exams in India, there is no doubt that one can prepare for both of these exams simultaneously. The real trick lies in hard work and dedication. Students should be ready to put in lots of effort and should be disciplined in their approach.\nOn one hand, the JEE Mains exam is conducted to grant admission to engineering colleges, and the NEET exam is conducted for admissions to Medical colleges.\nAlthough it is possible, it’s not an easy deal. It will require your full attention and patience. To prepare for JEE Mains and NEET, certain points should be kept in mind. It will surely help you prepare well and score good marks in both exams.\nCan Students Prepare NEET and JEE At the Same Time?\nStudents can get ready for both NEET and JEE simultaneously. If you excel in Math and Biology but are unsure whether to focus on JEE or NEET, you can opt for PCMB and prepare for both exams concurrently. Some students have successfully passed both NEET and JEE in the same year.\nHow to Prepare for IIT NEET and JEE Both?\nThe following are the effective Strategies for Simultaneous Preparation of NEET and JEE:\n1. Develop a Well-Structured Study Schedule\nInitiate your preparation by creating a comprehensive study schedule that strategically allocates time for both NEET and JEE subjects. Emphasize an equitable distribution of time across Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics.\n2. Assemble Essential Study Materials\nEnsure you have all the necessary study materials, encompassing textbooks, reference books, and online resources relevant to both NEET and JEE. Specifically, pay attention to Biology by utilizing the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) materials.\n3. Integrate Physics and Chemistry Topics\nGiven the substantial overlap in the syllabi of Physics and Chemistry for NEET and JEE, consider integrating your study sessions for these subjects. This approach can streamline your preparation process.\n4. Understand the Distinct Exam Patterns\nRecognize the nuanced differences in the examination patterns between NEET and JEE. While both exams are predominantly Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) based, it’s crucial to note that JEE incorporates numerical type questions. Familiarize yourself with the diverse number of questions allocated to each subject.\n5. Mock Tests and Past Papers\nBoost your confidence and familiarity with the exam patterns by engaging in regular practice with mock tests and solving previous years’ question papers for both NEET and JEE. This practice aids in effective time management and facilitates the identification of your strengths and weaknesses.\n6. Promptly Clarify Doubts\nMaintain a proactive approach to your learning by seeking clarification for any challenging concepts or doubts. Utilize the expertise of your teachers, mentors, or online resources. Addressing uncertainties early on contributes significantly to building a robust foundation in each subject.\n7. Regularly Review Key Concepts\nReinforce your understanding and retention of studied topics through consistent and regular revision. Incorporate dedicated time slots in your study timetable for this purpose, and consider creating succinct summary notes or flashcards to facilitate quick reviews.\n8. Access Guidance and Support from Experienced Teachers\nConsider enrolling in a coaching program, be it online or offline, to gain valuable insights and guidance from experienced teachers. They can provide you with effective strategies and the necessary support to navigate the challenges of preparing for both NEET and JEE concurrently."

        "human": "How should a dropper prepare for neet?",
        "assistant": "First thing to do as a dropper (which I strongly recommend) is that you should join a course. Online is good for you if you have self control. If you don't have self control and a good offline institute is nearby, you should go for it if you can afford. Even if you think you know everything already , it is better to have guidance along the way , plus you always learn something new which will be helpful. Hearing concepts from the teachers is very helpful aswell since it will stick in your memory longer. Even in exam I could recall what my teachers said since it was only a few months ago that they taught me. Another important thing is that do not join too many courses. Join as much as you can handle. I joined Aakash offline course and then joined NEETprep target batch for question practice aswell (practiced 22k questions) , but I couldn't give many tests on NEETprep due to lack of time. So , be careful./nI will try to enlist a few points in this answer about common mistakes commited by droppers. First you should identify your shortcomings out of these and accept them and then try to stop them. If you don't commit that particular mistake you can skip to the next point./nThinking too much about the past : here I'm talking about students who may be overconfident since they were close to selection the previous year. I saw this among others and also with me for a few weeks of my preparation, and some of my batchmates even cared about marks in NEET 21 after 6–7 months of preparation when the next NEET 22 was so close. Keep this clear in your mind that whatever you scored previous year does not matter. It does not mean that you would improve a lot without hardwork or that you would score more than others or that you are smarter. People forget almost everything within a span of a month or two , so it's better you work hard to improve your score much more the next year. It is good that you were close to selection last year but prepare like everything depends on it so that you can get your maximum output./nWorrying too much about the past : this is different from the first point, here I'm talking about students who worry about how many drops they've taken , or that their score wasn't good last year in comparison to others who are dropping this year , or that they wasted 11th and 12th completely , etc. Once you've decided that you want to drop a year for your preparation, you should forget about your past , whether it was good or bad. Focus only on your goal ahead and think about how you can boost your preparation every day. Do not think about others and focus on yourself since your competition is very huge , not just the people around you./nAiming at the bare minimum : I've seen droppers thinking just about selection in a govt college. I would say everyone should aim high. Set a dream college and work hard for that dream , do not lose your goal. Since you have a few months at hand , rather than thinking for the bare minimum you should score as much as you can without setting any target other than 720/720 so that you can get any college you want. My teachers always said that since you've got an extra year for preparation without any school or distractions , your target should be 720./nReading only theory : This is a mistake I committed during my 11th and 12th. I read theory but did not practice many questions. I did only the homework given by my teachers and that was all for question practice. I didn't even do PYQs. I believe you should focus equally on question practice and theory lectures/reading if you're starting from scratch on a topic. Since I already had clear concepts in theory in a few topics I revised briefly and jumped to question practice immediately in those topics , but that was not true for all topics. You also need to identify that what you should do for each topic. Whatever you do , question practice is very important in all subjects to know the applications of the concepts you study./nNot Making your own notes : This is one big mistake I saw droppers committing , they joined offline coaching , attended all classes and yet did not write much in their notebooks saying that they already have notes. My personal belief is that writing everything you can makes you retain stuff for a longer time, plus what else there is to do when you're attending a class , if you write it'll stop you from distracting yourself. Even in biology , even if you read only NCERT still you should just write what you hear in your class so that you retain it. Then at home you can read NCERT. If you're attending a class don't just sit without writing./nNeglecting Biology & Chemistry : It is very common that droppers think since they scored low in physics in their previous attempt(s) , they need to work hard in physics and then their exam will be cleared. But if you focus solely on 1 or 2 subjects and not on all the subjects it is sure that you'll score less. So focus on all the subjects and be sure to practice questions in all subjects adequately. You can adjust the proportion of questions practiced according to your marks in tests but never leave any subject unless you are scoring full marks consistently in that subject(which is not possible)/nNot having a Proper Plan(Long term) : This is a major issue , and droppers lose track of time if they don't have a proper long term plan. I personally joined offline coaching (Aakash Janakpuri) , so they set the long term schedule for me including revision and adequate time to do full mock tests after revision. But even if you're preparing online , be sure to have a schedule and stick to it no matter what. If you have joined a course/test series it is better to prepare according to their schedule./nNot Setting Short term targets : Along with a long term schedule , setting daily and weekly targets is very much important as well. Plan your week. Plan that what you will do every single day and try your best to complete that target. Try to leave a day or two every week for revision/backlog but I highly recommend you do not leave any backlog. I personally used to set targets in my mind for every 2–3 days and sometimes daily targets. I did questions of a chapter taught in class as soon as possible and didn't leave many backlogs. Rather than accumulating backlogs I'll do easy questions in advance if possible , if my schedule is tight later on and I have time before the topic is finished./nNot Giving Regular Tests : Along with weekly/fortnightly targets , tests are also important at about the same intervals. For tests , I followed Aakash Schedule. They scheduled offline tests at regular intervals. Plus if I had time in between , I attempted Neetprep tests(A course I joined online for question practice). But you don't need to focus too much on the source , trust the process not the resource. I believe all reputed coaching materials are good for NEET. If you're studying in that particular institute it makes it easier for you to get the best output from the tests and questions. Another thing tests can do is boost your morale after your hardwork. I personally preferred giving tests every 2 weeks and I studied very extensively for those tests to score good. There were other tests which I gave in between sometimes , many times the score wasn't great due to lack of time , but it motivates me even more to work harder./nNo proper Error Analysis : I personally did this mistake even in my drop year. From my package I circled the errors I made but didn't write a proper solution anywhere. And in my NEET 2021 preparation I didn't even bat an eye towards my errors. However , I realised late in my drop year that I need to analyse errors properly, for which I made a mistake notebook while revising. The mistakes help you a lot and if you've written a proper solution somewhere , it helps you recall quickly the approach for that question, since it is written by you. Plus when the exam was near , I revised only my mistakes and the formulae which I forgot./nFocusing too much on Difficult Questions : I have seen many serious droppers committing this particular mistake. They study too much for doing very difficult questions and they quickly move on to the difficult questions without properly doing the easy and moderate questions. This might induce a fear of that topic aswell if you find that you can't do any questions. For the past 3 years we've noticed that the complete exam was filled with easy and moderate questions only. And even before that hardly 2–3 difficult questions were asked sometimes , others were easy or moderate only. So until you have mastered all concepts from the NCERT and revised moderate questions several times , do not move on to difficult questions. And do not focus on a particular chapter/topic too much if your other topics are weak. This is very important , please take this seriously./nFocusing less on Rote Learning : Everyone knows that there are certain things in the NCERT (all subjects) which do not involve any logic and you just need to learn them anyhow. I have seen students leave these for the end or to not learn these at all. If it has been asked in the previous years or it can be asked (You can consult a teacher for that), then you should learn it. And don't leave it for the end , you won't have time. Just keep revising it throughout your preparation. Make a chart or a table and stick it on a wall so that you see it everyday. Use any mnemonics or tricks to learn such things but learn them quickly and revise them so that you have less to worry about at the end. Don't worry too much since people with average memory can retain that much for the exam. You don't need to be extraordinary to learn what is asked in NEET./nSpeed Before Accuracy : I did this mistake for a few mock tests. I saw other students who were very quick in doing questions and thought that I should try that aswell. But please note that accuracy comes before speed. First focus on doing the questions correctly, speed will come automatically. Don't rush through the exam. Plus now that biology asked could be tricky and lengthy (2022) and you have 20 minutes extra aswell , you need to focus on accuracy more. If someone is doing the questions very quickly it may be a result of more practice or it may be an act of stupidity. Don't try to do it yourself./nThese are all the common mistakes I saw which are committed by droppers. Ofcourse these are committed by those who are serious about their studies. If you're not serious and just wasting your time watching YouTube vlogs of NEET aspirants then you're doomed. If you know of any other common mistake please comment and I will reply if I can be of any help./nDetermination is important along with the strategy , avoiding these mistakes and having good teachers. I used to practice questions on my phone even during the time which I travelled. I used to read NCERT on my phone while traveling and I did questions even while eating , on my phone . Time is less and hence utilise as much as you can. I personally cannot sleep less than 6–7 hrs a day, hence I had to work efficiently./nThe drop year can cause a lot of stress and anxiety which accumulates over the years if you've taken multiple drops. Be sure to have some time for your family aswell (20–30 mins a day is good) so that you can have some relaxation. They'll talk to you nicely and try to motivate you when they know that they see you working hard this year and see a change in you./nAll the best from my side to all droppers! Do your best without worrying about the results too much."

The curriculum of Class 11 can be a bit intimidating for many, but it is in the best interest of the candidates to deal with it tactfully. Candidates must acquaint themselves with the NEET Class 11 chapters to develop a preparation strategy./nDevelop a comprehensive study schedule/nFrom the moment candidates are familiar with the syllabus, they should develop an effective study schedule to prepare for NEET 2025. NEET 2025 study plan should be structured so that there is no monotonous work and recreation time is included. Studying time must be in short bursts, especially during the time of the day when one feels most productive. The study plan should be organized and re-evaluated as time progresses.

        "human": "How to crack NEET in first attempt 2025",
        "assistant": "When starting to prepare for an NEET UG exam, the first step should be to prepare a timetable that will help candidates plan their time topic-wise or subject-wise. It should be ensured by the aspirants that the timetable is followed religiously. The timetable should be prepared to cover the topics which can be revised multiple times. This strategy will provide candidates with a clear picture of their schedule in the forthcoming months and will help in cracking NTA NEET 2025 in the first attempt./nDivide your time- Candidates should divide their time in such a way that an adequate amount of time is given to each session while preparing a strategy of how to crack NEET-UG in the first attempt. Prioritize the important topics and study them thoroughly. Make sure to take small breaks when studying for long hours./nSet deadlines- Deciding when to complete one topic and the whole syllabus will be beneficial considering there are few months left for the NEET exam. Candidates should set shorter and larger goals for them at the same time. Shorter goals will help candidates in knowing the topics covered each day while the longer goals will help in understanding how much they need to cover to crack NEET UG 2025 in the first attempt./nStudy Material- Collect the relevant study material to prepare for NEET 2025. There is no dearth of books in the market but for competitive exams like NEET, one should know the significant study material. The NEET NCERT textbooks for Class 11 and 12 are recommended as the best books for NEET./nStudy and examine/nAspirants of NEET UG 2025 must understand that it is a competitive exam, therefore, mugging up the concepts will not work. The NEET questions require a basic understanding of topics for which one needs to study hard but also smartly. After covering each topic examine where one stands and clear doubts at that time itself./nComprehensive Study- Try to make notes of every topic that is being covered to understand it better. This will be beneficial at the time of revision. Since the NCERT textbooks cover most of the NEET syllabus 2025, candidates must ensure that they are familiar with every topic of NCERT from end to end./nEvaluate your performance- Take some time out to revise the topics. Make flashcards if aspirants have a problem retaining the concepts. Make a note of all the doubts that are coming along the way and get help from the guides and books. This will help scrutinize the performance of each day and in this one can be his/her best judgment./nSubject-wise Preparation Tips/nThe three subjects that make up NEET are Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Students should arrange their schedules to allow them to review two subjects per day. This can be done in a certain way:/nPhysics/nPhysics numericals play an important role in exam since most medical students get apprehended while looking at the numerical. Either they completely skip the questions or attempt it incorrectly. However, looking at the recent trend of the Physics section it seems numerical plays an important role in scoring good marks in NEET. Hence, students after studying any chapter should solve around 30-40 numercials containing particular topics in that chapter. You can prepare notes for all the formulas and tabulate them in one notebook./nChemistry/nThe whole Chemistry syllabus of Class 11 and 12 is divided into three sections - Organic, Inorganic and Physical Chemistry. For Physical Chemistry, solve numerical questions 10-15 whenever you are revising a particular chapter for better conceptual clarity. For Inorganic chemistry focus on NCERT thoroughly. Similarly, in organic chemistry practice basic mechanisms and conversions in a rough notebook./nBiology/nBiology is divided into Botany and Zoology, comprising 50% of the NEET exam. Hence, it becomes one of the most important sections. However, looking at previous years' trends Biology section comes easy and often is one of the highest scoring out of all the three sections. All you need to do is study smart. Dedicate your time separately to the Botany and Zoology chapters. Thoroughly revise NCERT. Diagrams and tables from NCERTS need to be practised thoroughly./nPlease note that this strategy may or may not work for everyone. One has to understand and analyse their weaknesses and strengths and consistency towards NEET exam preparation./nPractice mock tests/nTaking mock tests becomes essential to know how to crack NEET in the first attempt as mock tests give an exam day experience. This will attune candidates to the pressure of the exam and complete the NEET paper in three hours. The mock tests should be of the same time frame as the NEET UG exam./nSolve previous year papers- Practicing last year’s question papers is essential for candidates aiming to crack NEET-UG in the first attempt. NEET question papers will help in understanding the level of the exam and the important topics./nRevise incorrectly attempted questions- After each mock test, make a note of wrong answers and start working on the weak areas. Make sure that there are no recurring mistakes. This will increase the candidates’ proficiency in the NEET UG exam."
